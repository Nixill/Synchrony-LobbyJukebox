# Artist variants
The following artists are available for the various tracks in the game:

## Lobby
Everyone except Hatsune Miku has a track here.

## Training
Only DannyB and OC ReMix have tracks here. (So does FamilyJules but it has to be loaded in a resourcepack.)

## Tutorial
Only DannyB has a track here.

## Zone Music:
- **Zones 1, 2, 3, and 4:** All soundtracks have tracks here!
- **Zone 5:** Danganronpa and Groove Coaster do not have tracks here.
- **Modded zones:** Can be assumed to only have one soundtrack (represented by DannyB but not actually created by any of the base game's artists). `MageZone_MAGE_ZONE` in particular is known to follow this assumption.

## Boss Music:
- **King Conga, Death Metal, Deep Blues, Coral Riff:** All soundtracks except Hatsune Miku.
- **Fortissimole:** All soundtracks except Miku, Groove Coaster, and Danganronpa
- **Dead Ringer, NecroDancer, NecroDancer2, Golden Lute, Frankensteinway, Conductor:** DannyB only.
- **Modded bosses:** Can be assumed to only have one soundtrack (represented by DannyB but not actually created by any of the base game's artists). `MageZone_SYMHPONY_OF_SORCERY` and `Rogue_EXEO` in particular are known to follow this assumption.
